cygwin_sshd_win7_init.txt
=========================

I have read the following 2 howtos ..
    [1] http://cygwin.com/faq/faq-nochunks.html#faq.using.sshd-in-domain
    [2] http://www.kgx.net.nz/2010/03/cygwin-sshd-and-windows-7/
where [2] was really helpfull.

The following is based on [2] and we should be able to config it easily.

Install Cygwin / OpenSSH - ssh daemon/service
==============================================

In the following writing we will use single quotes
to quote names, ie 'sshd', or 'jogamp'.
The quotes are not part of the name, 
but are ment to seperate the name from this text, 
i.e. don't enter the quotes.

1) Create accounts: 

- cmd.exe: 'lusrmgr' 
    - Users
        - New User.. (right click)
            - User Name: 'jogamp'
            - Enter a password
            - Uncheck: User must change password
            - Check: Password never exires
        - Right click on 'jogamp' -> properties (optional)
            - MemberOf
                - Add: 'Administrators'

    - Repeat this for account: 'cyg_server' ! (only for win7 service)
        - Same options

    - Repeat this for account: 'sshd' ! (only for win7 service)
        - Same options, _BUT_ don't add MemberOf 'Administrators'

2) Enable account: Administrator (or use powershell)

- cmd.exe: 'lusrmgr' 
    - enable Administrator
    - set password for Administrator

3) We need all these passwords, incl. Administrator !!
Please put them in a text file (user:password), ie c:\admin.txt


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
If you are not already run as user 'jogamp', 
please:
    - LOGOUT OF WINDOWS
    - LOGIN TO WINDOWS AS USER 'jogamp'
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

4) Install latest cygwin 1.7.5-1 as user 'jogamp'
    - http://www.cygwin.com/
    - Answer: For All users
    - Default location C:\cygwin
    - Add:
        - git
        - openssh
        - vim
        - ..
        - maybe: EVERYTHING but sources !

5) Update cygwin user mappings:
    - Start cygwin shell as user 'jogamp'
    - Run:
        mkpasswd -l > /etc/passwd
        mkgroup -l > /etc/group
        
6) Add public keys to each users (Administrator, jogamp, ..) cygwin home ~/.ssh/authorized_keys:
    - Start cygwin shell as user 'jogamp'
    ++++++++++
    - mkdir /home/jogamp/.ssh
    - cp authorized_keys /home/jogamp/.ssh
    - chown -R jogamp /home/jogamp/.ssh
    - chmod 0700 /home/jogamp/.ssh
    - chmod 0600 /home/jogamp/.ssh/*
    ++++++++++
    Repeat the above for account 'Administrator' as well!

Now continue with either:

    - cygwin_sshd_win7_usr_process.txt
